# EOG-data-classifier

This project is part of the Computational Neuroscience course held by the University of Tartu. The project aimed to classify activities made by participants based on Electrooculography (EOG) data of their eye movements using machine learning and deep learning models. [Eye Movement Analysis for Activity Recognition Using Electrooculography](https://perceptualui.org/research/datasets/RecognitionActivity/) dataset was used for training the models.

This code trains models that compare the performance of different machine learning and deep learning models on this dataset. [J. Rodrigo Flores](https://github.com/JRodrigoF/EOG_classifier) made preprocessing pipeline for the (EOG) data that other team members used. The detailed project description and obtained results are provided in our [blogpost](https://medium.com/@lastovko1997/classification-based-on-eye-movements-electro-oculography-7247d99b8e81).
